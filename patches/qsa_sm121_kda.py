"""QSA sparse decode on sm_121: the merged upstream kernel (KDA), with a Triton fallback.

Adapted from hashd1ve/qwen38-flash-next-one-dgx-spark (MIT) for this recipe.
Vendors sglang#36845 (Apache-2.0) onto lmsysorg/sglang:qwen38flashnext.

sglang#36845 was merged on 2026-08-30 with a different kernel than its 2026-08-28
revision: a KDA-1.5 agent-optimized implementation (Codex + Kimi K3) living in
`sglang/kernels/kda_kernels/qwen38_qsa_sm121/`. On a GB10 it measures 4-5x the
2026-08-28 Triton kernel at decode batch 1-4 (28 us vs 154 at batch 1) with
identical numerics, and it is what upstream ships going forward. Its contract is
exact — BF16, head dim 256, 24Q/2KV (TP1) or 12Q/1KV (TP2), batch <= 128,
selected KV <= 2055 — so this recipe keeps the 2026-08-28 Triton kernel
(patches/qsa_sm121_varlen.py) as the fallback for anything outside it.

This patcher edits the image's pristine `qwen_sparse_attn_backend.py`: the
trtllm gate stays as shipped (sm100 only; the XQA route it would open on sm_121
corrupts long context — see the README), and `_resolve_flash_attn_varlen_func`
gets a route that calls the KDA kernel inside its contract and the Triton
fallback otherwise. The KDA package itself is vendored verbatim under
patches/kda_kernels/ and mounted by serve.sh.

Validated on one DGX Spark (2026-08-30): exact needle retrieval 9/9 at
120k/190k/210k prompt tokens; decode after those prompts 46-92 tok/s (the
2026-08-28 kernel: 30-48); short-context decode unchanged.
